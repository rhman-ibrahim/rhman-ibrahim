## 1. Who Am I

### The Start

I graduated from Alexandria University in Egypt with a bachelor's degree in Accounting from the Faculty of Financial and Managerial Studies, formerly known as the Faculty of Commerce.

> It was really one assignment that changed everything — in the MIS (Management Information System) lecture, when the doctor asked us to create a landing page for marketing any product or service of our choice using HTML and CSS.

Back then, most of my peers chose to buy ready-made projects from seniors, but I was fascinated by the idea of creating something entirely from my own vision — exactly how I wanted things to be. The rest was really epic.

### **[Web Aspects 256](https://web-aspects-256.hashnode.dev)** — The Blog

This **[blog](https://web-aspects-256.hashnode.dev)** consists of 128 articles, each exactly 256 words long — that’s where its name comes from. Through it, I aim to share everything I’ve learned with those who are interested. During this project, we’ll build an exciting project called **256Cube** using Django and React.

> 256Cube is an anonymous, text-based social platform where every user is identified not by a username, but by a color.

Below is the table of contents for my blog. At the time of writing this *Read Me File*, it’s still a work in progress — but I’ll do my best to deliver it all as soon as possible, day by day.

## 2. What Am I Using

Choosing the tools that suited me was never an easy mission. I tried many until I settled with **Django (DRF)** and **React**. There are truly dozens of options — each with its own pros, cons, and brilliant minds behind it.

Before Django and Python, I worked with Java and Spring, then moved to PHP with Laravel and Symfony. To be honest, I once hated the idea of using JavaScript on the server side, and not learning it earlier is something I might regret now. Over time, I realized it’s never about what we like or dislike — it’s about using the **right tool for the job**, and always being willing to learn and adapt.

> From my own point of view, Django (DRF) and React together bring what’s needed in about 85% of projects.

## 3. What Am I Doing

### First, What I Was Doing

From many points of view, I might have wasted time learning and wandering — but I see it differently. After learning C and Java and solving programming exercises, I didn’t know exactly where I was heading. Everything looked fascinating — developing landing pages, applications, penetration testing (after 18 months of courses and workshops), and database query optimization.  

I walked all these paths, and I would never regret it. Every journey added something valuable, and the pleasure of learning and creating was always enough.

### Now

Everything has its pros and cons — that’s not subjective, especially when it comes to web development. You can run it anywhere: mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop — anything with a screen (except maybe a microwave).  

Less development time, reusable APIs everywhere, built once and used wherever. No installs, no requirements — just visit the link. So, no doubt, **web development is the big deal**.

I decided to focus on the main parts — the core elements every application needs: authentication, real-time messaging, layouts, and form management. My goal is to build my own solid foundation and be well-prepared for any opportunity that comes my way.

## 4. What Am I Aiming For

I saw the opportunity to change how things work around me. A web application can be the solution to almost any problem.  

I truly love **automation and transformation**, and I dream of transforming 100% of my beloved city, **Alexandria**, through my web solutions.
